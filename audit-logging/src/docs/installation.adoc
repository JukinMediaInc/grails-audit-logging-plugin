== Installation

Add to your build.gradle project dependencies block:

[source,groovy]
----
/** Project dependencies **/
dependencies {
   ...
   compile 'org.grails.plugins:audit-logging:2.0.0'
}
----

Run

....
    grails compile
....

or another script that triggers dependency resolution, and then the audit-quickstart script to generate the domain classes and add the initial configuration settings.

=== Create your Domain Artifact using audit-quickstart


NOTE: After installing the plugin, you must perform the following command to let the plugin create the audit-logging domain class within your project.

....
    grails audit-quickstart <your.package.name> <YourAuditLogEventClassName>
....

example:

....
    grails audit-quickstart org.myaudit.example AuditTrail
....

Afterwards, set the mapping and constraint settings accordinghly in the created Domain Artifact.

Advantage of this approach is that you got full control of the Audit Domain Class.
